I am a second year Research Master student Linguistics and Communication Sciences at Radboud University Nijmegen. I have also completed the Bachelor's programme English Language and Culture at Radboud University Nijmegen. 
I am mostly interested in syntax and psycholinguistics, with a focus on how humans are able to understand spoken language in noisy environments.
